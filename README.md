# Signal Processing: Bionics
Project/research in regard to signals, connected to Bionic prosthetics development.

## Data
Possible sources of data:
 * [EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset](https://archive.physionet.org/pn4/eegmmidb/)
 * article [EEG datasets for motor imagery brain computer interface](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316690456_EEG_datasets_for_motor_imagery_brain_computer_interface)
 * Materials from "Decoding finger movement in humans using synergy of EEG cortical current signals" paper. Correspondence and requests for materials should be addressed to N.Y. (email: yoshimura@pi.titech.ac.jp) 
 * (? possibly they dont have any linkts to data in this paper, currently I dont see one) Materials from "Investigating Neural Representation of Finger-Movement Directions Using Electroencephalography Independent Components" paper.
 * [Evaluation of EEG Features in Decoding Individual Finger Movements from One Hand](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cmmm/2013/243257/)
 * [Brainâ€“computer interface robotics for hand rehabilitation after stroke: a systematic review](https://jneuroengrehab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12984-021-00820-8)
